# pokedex_for_troubleshooting
for troubleshooting purposes only - inconsistencies with boot.dev cli

stack used:
- WSL
- npm version v22.15.0 (like the lesson) + whatever typescript needs 
- bootdev cli

to reproduce - run "bootdev run 002241a8-2fa9-44c9-a4d9-03bf6ef3a9bb" a bunch of times from the project directory and check for inconsistencies.
