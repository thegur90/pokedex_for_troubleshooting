# pokedex_for_troubleshooting
for troubleshooting purposes only - inconsistencies with boot.dev cli

stack used:
- WSL
- npm version v22.15.0 (like the lesson) + whatever typescript needs 
- bootdev cli

to reproduce first build (with "npm run build" or "npm run dev" if you want to build+run) run "bootdev run 062a8eef-3e51-4000-8f80-d8df57075718" a bunch of times from the project directory and check for inconsistencies.
